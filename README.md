# NonceMiner

NonceMiner is a cross-platform mining client built with the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework.  
Its underlying mining logic is powered by the open-source software [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig).  
With a simple graphical interface, you can easily participate in **Nonce token mining** on the GEB network and earn corresponding **Nonce tokens** as rewards.

## üì• Installation & Usage

### GUI Version (Recommended)

1. Visit the [Releases page](../../releases)  
2. Download the appropriate installer or archive for your operating system:  
   - Windows: `.exe` installer  
   - macOS: `.dmg` / `.zip`  
   - Linux: use the `xmrig` CLI version directly
3. Run the installer or extract the archive, then launch the application to start mining.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note for Windows Users**  
Since NonceMiner uses `xmrig` as the mining backend, some antivirus software may falsely flag it as a virus.  
You can add the installation folder to the exclusion list in **Windows Security ‚Üí Virus & Threat Protection**, to prevent the system from blocking it.

### CLI Version (Linux)

Linux users can download the appropriate `xmrig` binary from the [xmrig release page](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases) and mine directly without the GUI:

```bash
./xmrig --user evmAddress,wasmAddress --url p.nonce.world:3334 --coin XMR -p x -k
```
evmAddress: Your EVM address

wasmAddress: Your GEB WASM address (optional)

p.nonce.world: Official GEB mining pool address

You can open [https://miner.nonce.world/](https://miner.nonce.world) in your browser, enter your EVM address, and check your earnings.
